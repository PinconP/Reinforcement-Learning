# Reinforcement_Learning Repository

## Introduction

This repository is my personal space for learning and experimenting with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. It's a growing collection of implementations and notes, reflecting my journey as a master's student in Robotics and Interactive Systems.

## Implemented Algorithms

I've had the opportunity to work on a few algorithms so far. Here's what I've covered:

- [x] **Q-Learning**: My initial steps into RL, understanding the basics.
- [x] **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Exploring policy gradient methods and their applications.
- [x] **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Combining classical RL with deep learning.

## Upcoming Algorithms

There's much more I'm eager to learn. Here's what's next on my list:

- [ ] **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**
- [ ] **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**
- [ ] **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**
- [ ] **Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)**
- [ ] **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**
- [ ] **Distributed Distributional Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG)**

## Goals

I'm sharing my progress here with the hope that it might be useful to others on a similar path. It's a learning process for me, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you're also working on RL. I'm happy to connect and learn together.
